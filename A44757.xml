            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce Addreſſes are in faſhion, give me leave to make one to you. This is neither the Effect of Fear, Intereſt, or Reſentment; therefore you may be ſure it is ſincere: and for that reaſon it may expect to be kindly received. Whether it will have power enough to Convince, dependeth upon the Reaſons, of which you are to judge; and upon your preparation of Mind, to be perſwaded by Truth, whenever it appeareth to you. It ought not to be the leſs welcom, for coming from a friendly hand, one whoſe kindneſs to you is not leſſened by difference of Opinion, and who will not let his thoughts for the Publick be ſo tyed or confined to this or that Sub-diviſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as to ſtifle the Charity, which beſides all other Arguments, is at this time become neceſſary to preſerve us.</p>
            <p>I am neither ſurprized nor provoked, to ſee that in the condition you were put into by the Laws, and the ill circumſtances you lay under, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Excluſion and Rebellion laid to your Charge, you were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make your ſelves leſs uneaſie and obnoxious to Authority. Men who are ſore, run to the neareſt Remedy with too much haſte, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all the conſequences: Grains of allowance are to be given, where Nature giveth ſuch ſtrong Influences. When to men under Sufferings it offereth Eaſe, the preſent Pain will hardly allow time to examine the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; and the ſtrongeſt Reaſon can hardly gain a fair Audience from our Mind, whilſt ſo poſſeſſed, till the ſmart is a little allayed.</p>
            <p>I do not know whether the Warmth that naturally belongeth to new Friendſhips, may not make it a harder Task for me to perſwade you. It is like telling Lovers, in the beginning of their Joys, that they will in a little time have an end. Such an unwelcome Style doth not eaſily find credit: but I will ſuppoſe you are not ſo far gone in your new Paſſion, but that you will hear ſtill; and therefore I am under the leſs diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I offer to your conſideration two things. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100963:3"/>cauſe you have to ſuſpect your new Friends. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> the Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon you, in Chriſtianity and Prudence, not to hazard the Publick Safety, neither by deſire of Eaſe, nor of Revenge.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt:</hi> Conſider that notwithſtanding the ſmooth Language which is now put on to engage you, theſe new Friends did not make you their Choice, but their Refuge: They have ever made their firſt Courtſhips to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and when they were rejected there, they made their Application to you in the ſecond place. The Inſtances of this, might be given in all times. I do not repeat them, becauſe whatſoever is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, muſt be tedious, the truth of this Aſſertion being ſo plain, as not to admit a Diſpute. You cannot therefore reaſonably flatter your ſelves, that there is any Inclination to you. They never pretended to allow you any Quarter, but to uſher in Liberty for themſelves under that ſhelter. I refer you to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> and to the <hi>Journals</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> where you may be convinced, if you can be ſo miſtaken, as to doubt; nay, at this very hour, they can hardly forbear, in the height of their Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to let fall hard words of you. So little is Nature to be reſtrained; it will ſtart out ſometimes, diſdaining to ſubmit to the Uſurpation of Art and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This Alliance, between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is bringing together the Two moſt contrary things that are in the World. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not onely diſlike the allowing Liberty, but by its Principles it cannot do it. Wine is not more expreſly forbidden to the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> then giving Hereticks Liberty is to <hi>Papiſts:</hi> They are no more able to make good their Vows to you, then Men married be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and their Wife alive, can confirm their Contract with another. The continuance of their kindneſs, would be a habit of Sin, of which they are to repent, and their Abſolution is to be had upon no other terms, than their Promiſe to deſtroy you. You are therefore to be hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged now, onely that you may be the better ſqueezed at another time. There muſt be ſomething Extraordinary, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſetteth up Bills, and offereth Plaiſters, for tender Conſciences; By all that hath hitherto appeared, her skill in Chirurgery lyeth chiefly in a quick Hand, to cut off Limbs; but ſhe is the worſt at Healing, of any that ever pretended to it.</p>
            <p>To come ſo quick from another extream, is ſuch an unnatural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you ought to be upon your Guard; the other day you were <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> Now, you are <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> This is a violent change, and it will be fit for you to pauſe upon it, before you believe it: If your features are not altered, neither is their Opinion of you, whatever may be pretended. Do you believe leſs than you did, that there is Idolatry in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> ſure you do not. See then, how they treat both in Words and Writing, thoſe who entertain that Opinion. Conclude from hence, how inconſiſtent their favour is with this ſingle Article, except they give you a Diſpenſation for this too,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100963:3"/>and by a <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> ſecure you that they will not think the worſe of you.</p>
            <p>Think a little how dangerous it is to build upon a Foundation of Paradoxes. Popery now is the only friend to Liberty, and the known enemy to Perſecution: The men of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> are above all other eminent for Loyalty. The <hi>Quakers</hi> from being declared by the Papiſts not to be Chriſtians, are now made Favourites, and taken into their particular Protection; they are on a ſudden grown the moſt Accompliſhed men of the Kingdom, in good Breeding, and give Thanks with the beſt Grace, in double refined Language. So that I ſhould not wonder, though a man of that Perſw aſion, in ſpite of his Hat, ſhould be Maſter of the Ceremonies. Not to ſay harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er words, theſe are ſuch very new things, that it is impoſſible not to ſuſpend our belief, till by a little more Experience we may be inform'd whether they are Realities or Apparitions: We have been under ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſtakes, if theſe Opinions are true; but for the preſent, we are apt to be incredulous; except we could be convinced, that the Prieſts words in this Caſe too, are able to make ſuch a ſudden, and effectual change; and that their Power is not limited to the Sacrament, but that it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to alter the nature of all other things, as often as they are ſo diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>Let me now ſpeak of the Inſtruments of your Friendſhip, and then leave you to judge, whether they do not afford matter of Suſpition. No Sharpneſs is to be mingled where Healing only is intended; ſo nothing will be ſaid to expoſe particular men, how ſtrong ſoever the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be, or how clear the Proofs to make it out. A word or two in general, for your better caution, ſhall ſuffice: Suppoſe then, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſake, that the Mediators of this new Alliance, ſhould be ſuch as have been formerly imployed in Treaties of the ſame kind, and there detected to have Acted by Order, and to have been Impowered to give Encouragements and Rewards. Would not this be an Argument to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them?</p>
            <p>If they ſhould plainly be under Engagements to one ſide, their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the other, ought to be received accordingly; their fair Pretences are to be looked upon as part of their Commiſſion, which may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably give them a Diſpenſation in the caſe of Truth, when it may bring a prejudice upon the Service of thoſe by whom they are imployed.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be men who having formerly had Means and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perſwade by Secular Arguments, have in purſuance of that Power, ſprinkled Money amongſt the Diſſenting Miniſters; and if thoſe very men ſhould now have the ſame Authority, practice the ſame Methods, and Disburſe, where they cannot otherwiſe perſwade: It ſeemeth to me to be rather an Evidence than a Preſumption of the Deceit.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be Miniſters among you, who by having fallen under Temptations of this kind, are in ſome ſort engaged to continue their Frailty, by the awe they are in leſt it ſhould be expoſed: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of theſe unfortunate men muſt ſure have the leſs force, and their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100963:4"/>Arguments, though never ſo ſpecious, are to be ſuſpected, when they come from men who have Mortgaged themſelves to ſevere Creditors that expect a rigorous obſervation of the Contract, let it be never ſo unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>If theſe, or any others, ſhould at this time preach up Anger and Vengeance againſt the Church of <hi>England;</hi> may it not without Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be ſuſpected, that a thing ſo plainly out of ſeaſon, ſpringeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Corruption than Miſtake; and that thoſe who act this Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick part, do not believe themſelves, but only purſue higher Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, endeavour to make good that part of their Contract which obligeth them, upon a Forfeiture, to make uſe of their inflaming Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? They might apprehend their Wages would be retrenched if they ſhould be Moderate: And therefore whilſt Violence is their Intereſt, thoſe who have not the ſame Arguments, have no reaſon to follow ſuch a Partial Example.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be men who by the load of their Crimes againſt the Government, have been bowed down to comply with it againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; who by incurring the want of a Pardon, have drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the neceſſity of an intire Reſignation: Such men are to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not to be believed. Nay, they themſelves, when they have diſcharged their Unwelcome Task, will be inwardly glad that their forced Endeavours do not ſucceed, and are pleaſed when men reſiſt their Inſinuations; which are far from being Voluntary or Sincere, but are Squeezed out of them by the weight of their being ſo Obnoxious.</p>
            <p>If in the height of this great dearneſs by comparing things, it ſhould happen, that at this inſtant, there is much a ſurer Friendſhip with thoſe who are ſo far from allowing Liberty, that they allow no Living to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant under them. Let the Scene lie in what part of the World it will, the Argument will come home, and ſure it will afford ſufficient ground to ſuſpect. Apparent Contradictions muſt ſtrike us; neither Nature nor Reaſon can digeſt them: Self-Flattery, and the deſire to Deceive our ſelves, to gratiſie a preſent Appetite, with all their Power, which is Great, cannot get the better of ſuch broad Conviction, as ſome things carry along with them. Will you call theſe vain and empty Suſpicions? have you been at all times ſo void of Fears and Jealouſies as to juſtifie your being ſo unreaſonably Valiant in having none upon this occaſion? Such an extraordinary Courage at this unſeaſonable time, to ſay no more, is too dangerous a Vertue to be commended.</p>
            <p>If then for theſe and a thouſand other Reaſons, there is cauſe to ſuſpect, ſure your new Friends are not to Dictate to you, or adviſe you; for inſtance, The Addreſſes that fly abroad every Week; and Murther us with <hi>another to the ſame;</hi> the firſt Draughts are made by thoſe who are not very proper to be Secretaries to the Proteſtant Religion; and it is your part onely to Write them out fairer again. Strange! that you who have been formerly ſo much againſt <hi>Set Forms,</hi> ſhould now be content the Prieſts ſhould Indite for you. The nature of Thanks is an unavoidable conſequence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100963:4"/>being Pleaſed or Obliged; they grow in the Heart, and from thence ſhew themſelves either in Looks, Speech, Writing, or Action: No man was ever Thankful becauſe he was bid to be ſo, but becauſe he had, or thought he had ſome Reaſon for it. If then there is cauſe in this Caſe to pay ſuch extravagant Acknowledgments, they will flow naturally, without taking ſuch pains to procure them, and it is unkindly done to Tire all the Poſt-Horſes with carrying Circular Letters to ſollicit that which would be done without any trouble or conſtraint: If it is really in it ſelf ſuch a Favour, what needeth ſo much preſſing men to be Thankful, and with ſuch eager circumſtances, that where Perſwaſions cannot delude, Threatnings are employed to fright them into a Compliance? Thanks muſt be voluntary, not only unconſtrained, but unſollicited, elſe they are either Trifles or Snares, they either ſignifie nothing, or a great deal more than is intended by thoſe that give them. If an inference ſhould be made, That whoſoever Thanketh the King for his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is by that engaged to Juſtifie it in point of Law; it is a greater ſtride than, I preſume, all thoſe care to make who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to Addreſs: If it ſhall be ſuppoſed, that all the Thankers will be Repealers of the <hi>TEST,</hi> when ever a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall Meet. Such an Expectation is better prevented before, than diſappointed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; and the ſureſt way to avoid the lying under ſuch a Scandal, is not to do any thing that may give a colour to the Miſtake: Theſe Beſpoken Thanks are little leſs improper than Love Letters that were Sollicited by the Lady to whom they are to be Directed: ſo, that beſides the little ground there is to give them, the manner of getting them, doth extreamly leſſen their Value. It might be wiſhed that you would have ſuppreſſed your impatience, and have been content for the ſake of Religion, to enjoy it within your ſelves, without the Liberty of a publick Exerciſe, till a Parliament had allowed it; but ſince that could not be, and that the Artifices of ſome amongſt you have made uſe of the Well-meant Zeal of the Generality to draw them into this Miſtake; I am ſo far from blaming you with that ſharpneſs which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the Matter in ſtrictneſs would bear, that I am ready to err on the ſide of the more gentle conſtruction.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between enjoying quietly the advantages of an Act irregularly done by others, and the going about to ſupport it againſt the Laws in being: the Law is ſo Sacred, that no Treſpaſs againſt it is to be Defended; yet Frailties may in ſome meaſure be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, when they cannot be Juſtified. The deſire of enjoying a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from which men have been ſo long reſtrained, may be a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that their Reaſon is not at all times able to reſiſt. If in ſuch a caſe, ſome Objections are leapt over, indifferent men will be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to lament the Occaſion, than to fall too hard upon the Fault, whilſt it is covered with the Apology of a good Intention; but where to reſcue your ſelves from the Severity of one Law, you give a Blow to all the Laws, by which your Religion and Liberty are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100963:5"/>and inſtead of ſilently receiving the benefit of this Indulgence, you ſet up for Advocates to ſupport it, you become voluntary Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and look like Counſel retained by the Prerogative againſt your old Friend <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> who hath done nothing to deſerve her falling thus under your Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>If the caſe then ſhould be, that the Price expected from you for this Liberty, is giving up your Right in the Laws, ſure you will think twice, before you go any further in ſuch a loſing Bargain. After gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thanks for the breach of one Law, you loſe the Right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the breach of all the reſt; you will not very well know how to defend your ſelves, when you are preſſed; and having given up the Queſtion, when it was for your advantage, you cannot recall it, when it ſhall be to your Prejudice. If you will ſet up at one time a Power to help you, which at another time by Parity of Reaſon ſhall be made uſe of to deſtroy you, you will neither be pitied, nor relieved againſt a Miſchief you draw upon your ſelves, by being ſo unreaſonably thankful. It is like calling in Auxiliaries to help, who are ſtrong enough to ſubdue you: In ſuch a caſe your Complaints will come too late to be heard, and your Sufferings will raiſe Mirth inſtead of Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>If you think, for your excuſe, to expound your Thanks ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to this particular caſe, others, for their ends, will extend them further; and in theſe differing Interpretations, that which is back'd by Authority will be the moſt likely to prevail; eſpecially when by the advantage you have given them, they have in truth the better of the Argument, and that the Inferences from your own Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are very ſtrong, and expreſs againſt you. This is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a groundleſs Suppoſition, that there was a late inſtance of it, the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, in the Houſe of Lords, where the firſt Thanks, though things of courſe, were interpreted to be the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the King's whole Speech, and a Reſtraint from the further Examination of any part of it, though never ſo much diſliked; and it was with difficulty obtained, not to be excluded from the liberty of objecting to this mighty Prerogative of Diſpenſing, meerly by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and uſual piece of good Manners, by which no ſuch thing could poſſibly be intended.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth, that ſome bounds are to be put to your good Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that the Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi> is too valuable a thing to be ventured upon a Complement. Now that you have for ſome time enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefit of the End, it is time for you to look into the Danger of the Means: The ſame Reaſon that made you deſirous to get Liberty, muſt make you ſolicitous to preſerve it: ſo that the next thought will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be, not to engage your ſelf beyond Retreat, and to agree ſo far with the Principles of all Religions, as not to rely upon a Deathbed Repentance.</p>
            <p>There are certain Periods of time, which being once paſt, make all Cautions ineffectual, and all Remedies deſperate. Our Underſtandings are apt to be hurried on by the firſt heats; which, if not reſtrained in time,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100963:5"/>do not give us leave to look back, till it is too late. Conſider this in the Caſe of your Anger againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and take warning by their Miſtake in the ſame kind, when after the late King's Reſtoration, they preſerved ſo long the bitter taſte of your rough uſage to them in other times, that it made them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Intereſt, and ſacrifice it to their Revenge.</p>
            <p>Either you will blame this Proceeding in them, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not follow it, or if you allow it, you have no reaſon to be offended with them; ſo that you muſt either diſmiſs your Anger, or loſe your Excuſe; except you ſhould argue more partially than will be ſuppoſed of Men of your Morality and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>If you had now to do with thoſe Rigid Prelates, who made it a Matter of Conſcience to give you the leaſt Indulgence; but kept you at an uncharitable diſtance, and even to your more reaſonable Scruples continued ſtiff and exorable, the Argument might be fairer on your ſide; but ſince the common Danger hath ſo laid open that Miſtake, that all the former Haughtineſs towards you is for ever extinguiſh'd, and that it hath turned the Spirit of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, into a Spirit of Peace, Charity and Condeſcention; ſhall this happy Change only affect the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And are you ſo in love with Separation, as not to be moved by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? It ought to be followed, were there no other reaſon than that it is a Vertue; but when beſides that, it is become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to your preſervation, it is impoſſible to fail the having its Effect upon you.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is never Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but when ſhe is out of Power, and therefore loſeth the Right of being Believed when ſhe pretendeth to it; the Anſwer is, <hi>firſt,</hi> it would be an uncharitable Objection, and very much miſs-timed? an unſeaſonable Triumph, not only ungenerous, but unſafe: So that in theſe reſpects it cannot be urged, without Scandal, even though it could be ſaid with Truth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not ſo in Fact, and the Argument muſt fall, being built upon a falſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; for whatever may be told you, at this very hour, and in the heat and glare of your preſent Sun-ſhine, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can in a moment bring Clouds again; and turn the Royal Thunder upon your Heads, blow you off the Stage with a Breath, if ſhe would give but a Smile or a kind Word; the leaſt Glimpſe of her Complyance, would throw you back into the ſtate of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and draw upon you all the Arrears of Severity, which have accrued during the time of this kindneſs to you, and yet the <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100963:6"/>of <hi>England,</hi> withall her Faults, will not allow her ſelf to be reſcued by ſuch unjuſtifiable means, but chuſeth to bear the weight of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, rather than lie under the burthen of being Criminal.</p>
            <p>It cannot beſaid, that ſhe is unprovoked; Books and Letters come out every day, to call for Anſwers, yet ſhe will not be ſtirred. From the ſuppoſed Authors and the Stile one would ſwear they were Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, and had made a Contract to fall out with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> There are Laſhes in every Addreſs, Challenges to draw the Pen in every Pamphlet; in ſhort, the faireſt occaſions in the World given to quarrel; but ſhe wiſely diſtinguiſheth between the Body of Diſſenters, whom ſhe will ſuppoſe to Act, as they do, with no ill intent; and theſe ſmall Skirmiſhers pickt and ſent out to Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queer, and to begin a Fray amongſt the Proteſtants, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as well as the advantage of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conduct is ſo good, that it will be Scandalous not to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it. It is not equal dealing, to blame our Adverſaries for doing ill, and not commend them when they do well.</p>
            <p>To hate them becauſe they Perſecuted, and not to be reconciled to them when they are ready to Suffer, rather than receive all the Advantages that can be gained by a Criminal Complyance, is a Principle no ſort of Chriſtians can own, ſince it would give an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them never to be Anſwered:</p>
            <p>Think a little, who they were that promoted your former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and then conſider how it will look to be angry with the Inſtruments, and at the ſame time to make a League with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of your Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Have you enough conſidered what will be expected from you? Are you ready to ſtand in every Borough by a Vertue of a <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> and inſtead of Election, be ſatisfied if you are returned?</p>
            <p>Will you in <hi>Parliament,</hi> juſtifie the Diſpenſing Power, with all its conſequences, and repeal the <hi>Teſt,</hi> by which you will make way for the Repeal of all the Laws, that were made to preſerve your Religion, and to Enact others that ſhall deſtroy it?</p>
            <p>Are you diſpoſed to change the Liberty of Debate, into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Obedience, and to be made Inſtruments to Repeal or Enact Laws, when the <hi>Roman Conſistory</hi> are <hi>Lords of the Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you ſo linked with your new Friends, as to reject any Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall offer you, if it ſhall not be ſo Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as to include the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in it?</p>
            <p>Conſider that the implyed Conditions of your new Treaty are no leſs, than that you are to do every thing you are deſired, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100963:6"/>examining, and that for this pretended Liberty of Conſcience, your real Freedom is to be Sacrificed: Your former Faults hang like Chains ſtill about you, you are let looſe only upon Bayl; the firſt Act of Non-compliance, ſendeth you to jayl again.</p>
            <p>You may ſee that the Papiſts themſelves, do not rely upon the Legality of this Power, which you are to Juſtifie, ſince they being ſo very earneſt to get it Eſtabliſhed by a Law, and the doing ſuch very hard things in order, as they think to obtain it, is a clear Evidence, that they do not think, that the ſingle Power of the Crown is in this Caſe a good Foundation; eſpecially when this is done under a Prince, ſo very tender of all the Rights of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he would think it a diminution to his Prerogative, where he conceiveth it ſtrong enough to go alone, to call in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive help to ſtrengthen and ſupport it.</p>
            <p>You have formerly blamed the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not without reaſon, for going ſo far as they did in their Compliance; and yet as ſoon as they ſtopped, you ſee they are not only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, but Proſecuted: Conclude then from this Example, that you muſt either break off your Friendſhip, or reſolve to have no Bounds in it. If they do not ſucceed in their Deſign, they will leave you firſt; if they do, you muſt either leave them, when it will be too late for your Safety, or elſe after the ſqueazineſs of ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Surplice, you muſt be forced to ſwallow Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>Remember that the other day thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Trimmers</hi> for enduring you, and now by a ſudden Turn, you are become the Favourites; do not deceive your ſelves, it is not the Nature of laſting Plants thus to ſhoot up in a Night; you may look gay and green for a little time, but you want a Root to give you a continuance. It is not ſo long ſince, as to be forgotten, that the <hi>Maxim</hi> was, <hi>It is impoſſible for a Diſſenter, not to be a REBEL.</hi> Conſider at this time in <hi>France,</hi> even the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are ſo far from being Imployed, that they are Diſarmed: their ſudden Change maketh them ſtill to be diſtruſted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they are Recoriciled: What are you to expect then from your dear Friends, to whom, whenever they ſhall think fit to throw you off again, you have in other times given ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for their excuſe?</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, you Act very unskilfully againſt your viſible Intereſt, if you throw away the advantages, of which you can hardly fail in the next probable Revolution. Things tends natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what you would have, if you would let them alone, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100963:7"/>not by an unſeaſonable Activity loſe the Influences of your good Star, which promiſeth you every thing that is proſperous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> convinced of its Errour in being Severe to you; the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when ever it meeteth, ſure to be Gentle to you; the next Heir bred in the Country which you have ſo often Quoted for a Pattern of Indulgence; a general Agreement of all thinking Men, that we muſt no more cut our ſelves off from the Proteſtants abroad, but rather inlarge the Foundations upon which we are to build our Defences againſt the Common Enemy; ſo that in Truth, all things ſeem to conſpire to give you eaſe and ſatisfaction, if by too much haſt to anticipate your good Fortune; you do not deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants have but one Article of Human Strength, to oppoſe the the Power which is now againſt them, and that is, not to loſe the advantage of their numbers, by being ſo unwary as to let themſelves be divided.</p>
            <p>We all agree in our Duty to our Prince, our Objections to his Belief, do not hinder us from ſeeing his Vertues; and our not complying with his Religion, hath no effect upon our Allegiance; we are not to be Laughed out of our Paſſive Obedience, and the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, though even thoſe who perhaps owe the beſt part of their Security to that Principle, are apt to make a Jeſt of it.</p>
            <p>So that if we give no advantage by the fatal Miſtake of miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our Anger, by the natural courſe of things, this Danger will paſs away like a ſhower of Hail; fair weather will ſucceed, as lowring as the Sky now looketh, and all by this plain and eaſie Receipt. Let us be ſtill, quiet and undivided, firm at the ſame time to our Religion, our Loyalty, and our Laws, and ſo long as we continue this method, it is next to impoſſible, that the odds of two hundred to one ſhould loſe the Bett; except the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath been ſo long barren of Miracles, ſhould now in her declining Age, be brought to Bed of One that would out-do the beſt ſhe can brag of in her <hi>Legend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, the ſhort Queſtion will be, Whether you will joyn with thoſe who muſt in the end run the ſame Fate with you. If Proteſtants of all ſorts, in their Behaviour to one another, have been to blame, they are upon the more equal terms, and for that very reaſon it is fitter for them now to be reconciled. Our Diſ-union is not only a Reproach, but a Danger to us; thoſe who believe in modern Miracles, have more Right, or at leaſt more Excuſe, to neglect all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cautions; but for us, it is as juſtifiable to have no Religion, as wilfully to throw away the Human Means of preſerving it.
